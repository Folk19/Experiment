iReporter Anahita Valakche sums up the reasons to love Amsterdam pretty well:
"Not only is Amsterdam full of amazing museums, the whole city feels like you are living in a painting.
"My other favorite aspect of Amsterdam is its high standards of living and the quality of life -- even though it is one of the most crowded tourist spots in the world.
"Also the people in Amsterdam are very friendly. Amsterdam is diverse in its culinary offerings and you can eat delicious Turkish, Moroccan, Indonesianand Surinamese food, etc."
And of course there are the canals, the bikes and the cafes.
